    <h3 style=color"red">What this is</h3>
    <p>My understanding, learning and philosophies on the education of pupils during their second developmental stage (11+). Using agile methodologies to produce collaborative value orientated education that brings learning to life for human beings who are considered children but are quickly encroaching upon adulthood. </p>
        
        <p>Instead of trying to reform a system that doesn't work, I want to work with people who are just as aware of the failings of a broken system. Much as fixing and replacing broken parts on an old car will never make it a space shuttle, mending outdate forms of communication designed for a different age will never create engaged individuals</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is an "open source" resource with the ideas and philosophies that I have towards creating a "Good School" fit for the purpose of education rather than pigeon-holing young people into categories believing that the only purpose of schooling is vocational. </p>
